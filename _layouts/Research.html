    <h5><a href= "/assets/Suddenstops_Afavi.pdf">Quantitative Exploration of Fiscal Rule in WAEMU</a> (JMP), 2021,  <a href= "/assets/Suddenstops_Slides_Afavi.pdf"> Slides</a>  </h5>
  
       <p align="justify">West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) countries are capital market integrated and design jointly their fiscal and monetary policies.
         This work makes a quantitative analysis of the fiscal rule in this economic and monetary union and characterizes the optimal reform. The theoretical framework used 
        is a model of fiscal policy where present biased governments faced shocks on their fiscal needs. The structure of the model implies a trade-off between flexibility 
        for government to react to shocks and commitment to limit its incentives to overborrow. The main result is that a uniform fiscal rule for all WAEMU countries is not 
        optimal. On the one hand, the more volatile is the shock, the more flexible is the fiscal rule. On the other hand, the more present-biased is the government, the more 
        stringent is the fiscal rule. We also make a welfare analysis due to the discrepancy between the optimal fiscal rule and that in place in WAEMU.  We finally consider
        the general equilibrium effects on the common interest rate to investigate quantitative optimal joint fiscal rule for WAEMU.</p> 
          
    <h5><a href="/assets/HANK_TANK_Afavi.pdf" > International Business Cycle Accounting</a>, 2021, <a href= "/assets/HANK_TANK_slides_Afavi.pdf"> Slides</a>  </h5>
   
    <p align="justify"> We develop a method that can give insights to researchers to better specify their quantitative models in international business cycles studies. The
     guidance comes from the application of accounting procedure that is base on prototype model of international growth model including wedges that captures all the 
     eventual frictions and distortions of markets. For each country, we include -efficiency wedge, labor wedge, investment wedge, government wedge, preference wedge
     and foreign asset wedge. We then demonstrate the method by applying to US and Canada during the Great recession (2007-2008). We found that the economic downturns 
     in both countries during this period is primary due to US investment wedge, US labor wedge, US efficiency wedge and secondary is due to Canada investment wedge. 
     Those results suggest that the crisis has started in US and has propagated to Canada.  </p>
