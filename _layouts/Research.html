         <!-- <h5>Quantitative Exploration of Fiscal Rules for WAEMU Countries (JMP), 2022 ,  <a href= "/assets/FiscalRules_Slides_Chaffa.pdf"> Slides</a>  </h5>-->
       <p align="justify"> The West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) has integrated capital market and design jointly their  monetary policies and fiscal rules.
          To start, I document a significant heterogeneity in government revenue, spending, and debt across WAEMU countries. This paper offers a quantitative analysis of 
          the fiscal rule in this economic and monetary union and characterizes an optimal reform. The theoretical framework is a model of fiscal policy where
          present-biased governments face shocks to their fiscal needs. The  model features a trade-off between flexibility for the government to react to shocks and
          commitment to limit its incentives to overborrow. I found that the current uniform 3\% deficit rule improves the citizenry's welfare for all WAEMU countries
          compared to a counterfactual scenario with no fiscal rule. Country-specific fiscal rules allow for a Pareto improving reform over the current uniform rule. 
          Each country's optimal deficit limit level is influenced by the volatility of the shocks  its government faces and the level of the political economy frictions 
          of this government.</p>

     <h5> International Business Cycle Accounting, 2022  </h5>
    
         <p align="justify"> We develop a method that can give insights to researchers to better specify their quantitative models in international business cycles studies. The
     guidance comes from the application of accounting procedure that is base on prototype model of international growth model including wedges that captures all the 
     eventual frictions and distortions of markets. For each country, we include -efficiency wedge, labor wedge, investment wedge, government wedge, preference wedge
     and foreign asset wedge. We then demonstrate the method by applying to US and Canada during the Great recession (2007-2008). We found that the economic downturns 
     in both countries during this period is primary due to US investment wedge, US labor wedge, US efficiency wedge and secondary is due to Canada investment wedge. 
     Those results suggest that the crisis has started in US and has propagated to Canada.  </p>
